# About Dataset

Source Images Description
The team of authors has constructed a new large-scale land-cover dataset with Gaofen-2 (GF-2) satellite images. This new dataset, which is named as Gaofen Image Dataset with 15 categories (GID-15), has superiorities over the existing land-cover dataset because of its large coverage, wide distribution, and high spatial resolution. The large-scale remote sensing semantic segmentation set contains 150 pixel-level annotated GF-2 images, which is labeled in 15 categories. Some of the images are from the paper: Land-Cover Classification with High-Resolution Remote Sensing Images Using Transferable Deep Models.

## Important
The resulting images are in .tif format and 256x256 resolution obtained with the patchify library. Masks contain values ​​from 0 to 15. Dataset use 50% of all source train images

## How I used this dataset?
I have tested various backbones with Unet architecture. MobileNet showed the best results. (0.44 IOU-score)
